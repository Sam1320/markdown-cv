## Work Experience

`Aug 2023-Present`
**AI/Machine Learning Engineer** at [Conductor](https://www.conductor.com/)

`Oct 2022 - May 2023`
**Machine Learning Engineer** at [Motor-AI](https://motor-ai.com/)

- Developed a semi-automated labeling pipeline for instance segmentation and 2D object detection utilizing SOTA open-source models. Optimized the performance through iterative prompt engineering across different modalities.
- Created label cleaning applications for both 2D bounding boxes and segmentation masks, streamlining the curation of automated annotations. Trained and performed real-time inference on a semantic segmentation model using PyTorch-ONNX-TensorRT.
- Created a radar tracking pipeline. Including realtime object detection, tracking of multiple objects, tracking evaluation and visualization.
- Designed a modular fail-safe system architecture, focusing on redundancy, robustness, decentralization, coordination, and latency. Implemented POC of the basic building blocks. % and handed it over for further development.

`Aug 2021 - Oct 2022`
**Robotics & Deep Learning Research Assistant** at [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/cs-ml/index)

- Developed an interactive visualization system for fundational robotics algorithms: Kalman Filters, Particle Filters, SLAM, A*, PID controllers, etc.
- Setup a visual SLAM system with a wheeled robot base using ROS1 and a raspberrypi 4. 
- Developed an end-to-end neural network training and inference pipeline for biometric identification using eye movements.
- Designed and implemented a labeling tool using Python and Tkinter to label predictions from a pupil tracking system.

`Nov 2020 - Mar 2021`
**Math Teaching Assistant** at [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/cs-ml/index)
