## Work Experience

`Aug 2023-Present`
**AI/Machine Learning Engineer** at [Conductor](https://www.conductor.com/)
- Building a self-managing prompt library for creating, orchestrating, validating, and evaluating prompts for different Language Models.
- Designed and built a large scale RAG system for recommending internal links to content creators using vector databases and LLMs.
- Leveraging domain-specific knowledge and semi-automated prompt engineering to deliver personalized applications for different use cases.

`Oct 2022 - May 2023`
**Machine Learning Engineer** at [Motor-AI](https://motor-ai.com/)

- Developed a semi-automated labeling pipeline for instance segmentation and 2D object detection utilizing SOTA open-source models. Optimized the performance through iterative prompt engineering across different modalities.
- Created label cleaning applications for both 2D bounding boxes and segmentation masks, streamlining the curation of automated annotations. Trained and performed real-time inference on a semantic segmentation model using PyTorch-ONNX-TensorRT.
- Created a radar tracking pipeline. Including realtime object detection, tracking of multiple objects, tracking evaluation and visualization.
- Designed a modular fail-safe system architecture, focusing on redundancy, robustness, decentralization, coordination, and latency. Implemented POC of the basic building blocks.

`Aug 2021 - Oct 2022`
**Robotics & ML Research Assistant** at [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/cs-ml/index)

- Developed an interactive visualization system for fundational robotics algorithms: Kalman Filters, Particle Filters, SLAM, A*, PID controllers, etc.
- Setup a visual SLAM system with a wheeled robot base using ROS1 and a raspberrypi 4. 
- Developed an end-to-end neural network training and inference pipeline for biometric identification using eye movements.
- Designed and implemented a labeling tool using Python and Tkinter to label predictions from a pupil tracking system.

`Nov 2020 - Mar 2021`
**Math Teaching Assistant** at [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/cs-ml/index)

- Delivered classroom lectures about linear algebra and anwsered student questions.
- Graded final exams and homework assignments providing appropriate feedback to students.

`Oct 2019 - Mar 2020`
**Working Student Software Engineer** at [Ada Health](https://www.ada.com/)
- Created labeling guidelines for unstructured medical texts to optimize training efficiency of NLP models.
- Designed and trained natural language processing models for knowldedge acquisition from various sources of structured medical data.
- Applied different data augmentation techniques and performed extensive data analysis with complex datasets. 


## Projects

`LangChain, Guidance, AWS Lambda, Modal, Vector DBs.`
[GroupLang](https://github.com/Sam1320/GroupLang)

Telegram bot with long term memory capable of planning and executing tasks, answering questions over documents, mapping messages to actions, unstructured data extraction, semantic user matching, relevant memory retrieval. It can also seek and wait for user feedback and clarification if required.

`Kotlin, Android Studio`
[Estimate My State](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sam.estimate)

Android app that leverages internal sensors to estimate position and velocity. Useful to evaluate multi-object tracking systems by having approximate ground truth states for arbitrary objects.

`Pytorch, OpenCV, Python`
[Webcam Game Controller](https://github.com/Sam1320/motorai_challenge)

A webcam-based game controller that uses a very lightweight neural network to detect hand gestures and control a game. 

`Python, Tkinter`
[Chess GUI and Engine](https://github.com/Sam1320/chessam)

A chess game with a GUI and different engines to play against, all implemented from scratch.

`Tensorflow, Computer Vision`
[Diabetic Retinopathy Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sam1320/capstone)

Neural network able identify if there are signs of Diabetic Retinopathy present in a retina image (taken with fundus photography) and classify each image into five different categories depending on the severity of the condition.


## Open Source Contributions
[Guidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance/blob/main/notebooks/art_of_prompt_design/react.ipynb)

Language model programming paradigm that offers superior control and efficiency compared to conventional prompting and chaining. It allows users to constrain generation (e.g. with regex and CFGs) as well as to interleave control (conditional, loops) and generation seamlessly.
